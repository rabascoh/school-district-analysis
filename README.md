# School District Analysis

## Overview

Following the original analysis of the school districts' scores, it was found that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty. The math and reading scores for ninth-grade students at Thomas High School (THS) appear to be altered. The purpose of this analysis is to replicate the original school district analysis after replacing the math and reading scores for ninth-grade THS students with NaNs (i.e., omit their data from the analyis) and determine how these changes affected the overall analysis.
